# hltools

hltools is a modern goldsrc map and asset toolchain. It is a rewrite of the [SDHLT](https://github.com/seedee/SDHLT/) tools, focused on faster compilation, clearer diagnostics, and new map and asset utilities.

The toolchain preserves established compiler behavior and map compatibility while using a cleaner architecture, reusable libraries and a unified command line interface. `hltools compile` is the primary compilation workflow.

Compiler stages are exposed as `hltools csg`, `hltools bsp`, `hltools vis` and
`hltools rad`; there are no separate stage executables.

## Work in progress

Under development. Bugs, incomplete behavior and output differences may still occur, especially on maps and features not yet covered by fixtures and automated tests.

The CPU compiler stages preserve reference compiler behavior across real maps and feature fixtures. GPU RAD is deliberately approximate; see [Accuracy and compatibility](#accuracy-and-compatibility).

## GPU lighting

GPU accelerated RAD is one of the largest additions. \
With `-gpu`, Vulkan compute handles direct light gathering and transfer form factors, significantly reducing lighting and total compile times on supported maps. Unsupported maps automatically use the CPU path.

Measured on `speedrun_celerior` from the same snapshot after CSG, BSP and VIS, using a Release build with `-extra -threads 12` on a Ryzen 5 5600H and an RTX 3050 Laptop GPU. Both values average two alternating runs.

```mermaid

    y-axis "Wall time (seconds)" 0 --> 120

```

| Path | Run 1 | Run 2 | Average |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU | 115.518 s | 115.547 s | 115.533 s |
| `-gpu` | 39.447 s | 38.635 s | 39.041 s |

On this map, `-gpu` is 2.96x faster and reduces RAD wall time by 66.2%.

## Leak diagnostics

Leak diagnostics were reworked. \
The new diagnostics point directly at the opening that needs to be fixed.

![Leak trace rework](.github/assets/leak-trace-rework.gif)

- The `.pts` pointfile follows the geometrically shortest route from the leaked entity to the outside.
- The hole is marked with a visible cross and its coordinates are printed.
- All leaking hulls are consolidated into one report.
- `-leakonly` stops immediately after writing the diagnostics.

## Lightmap atlas budget (AllocBlock)

GoldSrc packs lightmapped faces into 64 pages of 128x128 luxels. If they do not fit, the engine aborts with `AllocBlock: full`.

This early budget check was added in hltools. RAD runs it before direct light creation, light gathering, or bounce computation, so an impossible map fails before the expensive lighting work begins. \
Above 95% it prints a breakdown by texture ranked by lightmap footprint.

`hltools bsp info` prints the same breakdown for an already compiled BSP at any usage, which is how to see where the budget goes before a map is anywhere near the limit.

hltools tests several legal face orders against the same AllocBlock algorithm before writing the BSP and keeps the order that needs the fewest pages. Node and marksurface references are remapped safely. This slightly reduces packing gaps without changing geometry, texture scale or lightmap resolution. The engine still uses its original fixed 64 page allocator.

```text
!!! ERROR: LIGHTMAP ATLAS OVERFLOW - map exceeds the engine's 64 page limit
    usage    71 / 64 pages (111%)
    cause    too many lightmapped luxels; the engine aborts with "AllocBlock: full"
    action   raise the texture scale on the biggest consumers below, or make them smaller

    Lightmap atlas budget by texture (top consumers):
      texture                  faces       luxels  % budget
      --------------------------------------------------------------
      dev_r3_cs2y2             2,258      242,850     72.0%
      dev_c3_dhmsl0            1,702      119,917     36.6%
```

The exact luxel totals identify the textures to fix. Page usage can be slightly higher because atlas packing leaves gaps between rectangles.

## Embedded map source

`hltools compile` embeds the editable MAP source in the final BSP by default.
`hltools decompile` can restore it without reconstructing the map:

```powershell
hltools compile maps/example.map
hltools decompile maps/example.bsp restored/example.map
```

The archive includes the compile settings and used texture-light definitions.
GoldSrc ignores the appended ZIP data. Use `-noembedsource` to disable it. When
no source is embedded, `decompile` reconstructs the map from the BSP geometry.

## Building

Compiled Release archives for Windows and Linux are available from successful GitHub Actions runs. \
Each run provides the supported `hltools` artifact. Builds from `main` are also
published to the rolling [nightly release](https://github.com/speedrun-16/hltools/releases/tag/nightly).

Requirements:

- CMake 3.21 or newer.
- A C++17 compiler. Visual Studio 2022 is the primary Windows configuration.
- Optional GPU backend: `glslc` from the Vulkan SDK and a device with Vulkan support.

The build downloads pinned libzip and zlib sources and links them statically for
embedded map-source archives. GPU support is enabled automatically when `glslc`
is available. The first GPU build also downloads pinned Vulkan headers into
`build/_extern`. Use `-DHLTOOLS_GPU=OFF` for a CPU only build.

The commands below start in the repository root.

### Windows

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
./bin/hltools.exe -h
```

To build only the unified executable and its dependencies:

```powershell
cmake --build build --config Release --target hltools
```

### Linux

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
./bin/hltools -h
```

The complete build also produces verification executables in `bin/tests`.

```

`hltools compile` runs this pipeline in one process with a single combined log. \
The individual stage commands remain available when an editor or script expects the traditional workflow.

## Quick start

Compile a map with the CPU reference path:

```powershell
hltools compile maps/example.map
```

Fast iteration compile. In the unified command, `-fast` is seen by both VIS and RAD:

```powershell
hltools compile -fast maps/example.map
```

High quality lightmaps with GPU gathering:

```powershell
hltools compile -extra -gpu maps/example.map
```

Run the stages individually:

```powershell
hltools csg maps/example.map
hltools bsp maps/example
hltools vis maps/example
hltools rad -extra maps/example
```

Run `hltools <command> -h` for the authoritative option list. Options may appear before or after the map name for individual compiler commands.

## Source studio-model conversion

`hltools model convert` rebuilds a Source studio model as one self-contained
GoldSrc v10 MDL:

```powershell
hltools model convert cstrike/models/props/crate.mdl models/crate.mdl -game cstrike
```

The Source `.mdl` must have its sibling `.vvd` and `.dx90.vtx`, `.dx80.vtx`, or
`.vtx` file beside it. The converter reads LOD 0, embeds palettized skins up to
512x512, preserves bones and supported animations, and splits geometry that
exceeds GoldSrc limits. Source model versions 44 through 49 are supported.

Large skins are resized to 512x512 by default. Use `-chunkskins` to split the
skin and its geometry into tiles instead. A level of `2`, `4`, or `8` preserves
up to 1024, 2048, or 4096 pixels per axis with the default tile size:

```powershell
hltools model convert cstrike/models/props/crate.mdl models/crate.mdl -game cstrike -chunkskins 8 -sharedpalette
```

Skin options:

| Option | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `-maxskinsize <n>` | Set the tile size (`16..512`, step 16) | `512` |
| `-chunkskins <n>` | Split skins into `1`, `2`, `4`, or `8` tiles per axis | `1` (off) |
| `-sharedpalette` | Share one palette across skin tiles | Off |
| `-tilearea <10..100>` | Limit the surface area receiving dedicated tiles | `100` |

`-game` points at the Source content directory used to resolve VMT/VTF skins
from loose files and `_dir.vpk` archives. It is inferred when the input path is
under a `models` directory. Unresolved skins are replaced with an obvious purple
placeholder and reported after conversion. Use `-force` to overwrite an output.
Texture filtering and supported render flags are preserved during conversion.

## Full-resolution skybox models

GoldSrc's normal `gfx/env` sky path is conventionally limited to 256x256 faces.
`hltools model skybox` can instead turn six high-resolution TGA faces into a
large studio-model cube:

```powershell
hltools model skybox gfx/env/night models/night_sky -size 131072
```

The input files are
`night{up,lf,ft,rt,bk,dn}.tga`. Studio skins are limited to 512x512, so a
1024x1024 face is losslessly divided into four skins. The resulting cube uses
24 skins and 48 triangles; no face is resized. GoldSrc permits at most 64 skins
in one model, so larger skies are automatically divided across
`night_sky0.mdl`, `night_sky1.mdl`, and so on. Place one `cycler_sprite` for
every emitted model at the same origin.

The model skins carry `FLATSHADE`, `FULLBRIGHT`, and `NOMIPS`. `FULLBRIGHT`
makes a light entity unnecessary on engines that implement the standard studio
flags; placing a white light in the model room is still a harmless compatibility
fallback. RAD's default is already `-limiter 255`.

A reliable map setup is:

- Build a small sealed room in the void, preferably near the map origin.
- Put every `cycler_sprite` and an `info_overview_point` in that room.
- Set `reverse` to `1` on `info_overview_point`, so every leaf sees the
  model's leaf.
- Set worldspawn `MaxRange` to at least `200000`.

When porting a Source BSP, export native-sized faces first. `-skysize` supports
power-of-two sizes through 4096 for this workflow:

```powershell
hltools bsp port source.bsp staging/map.map -game path/to/game -skysize 1024
hltools model skybox staging/gfx/env/night staging/models/night_sky
```

## Command reference

### `compile`

```text
hltools compile [options] <map>
```

Accepts all CSG, BSP, VIS and RAD options, plus:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-dumpintermediates` | Write the CSG intermediate files instead of keeping only the memory handoff |
| `-noembedsource` | Do not append the editable map-source ZIP to the BSP |
| `-nochart` | Skip the final BSP usage chart |
| `-threads <n>` | Set the shared worker count; the default uses all cores |

`-onlyents` is intentionally supported only by CSG and is rejected by `hltools compile`.

Map source is embedded by default. The root `source.map` is self-contained:
it contains the effective `info_compile_parameters` and only the effective
`info_texlights` definitions for textures referenced by compiled faces.

`info_compile_parameters` uses stage-prefixed keys. Boolean options use `1`;
value options contain the option value:

```text
{
"classname" "info_compile_parameters"
"vis_fast" "1"
"rad_extra" "1"
"rad_bounce" "12"
}
```

The entity supplies stage-specific defaults to both `hltools compile` and the
individual `hltools csg`, `bsp`, `vis`, and `rad` commands. An actual
command-line value wins. In a traditional stage chain the entity travels
through intermediate BSPs so each stage can consume its keys, then RAD removes
it from the runtime entity lump. Commands operating on an embedded final BSP
read the recipe from its root MAP instead.

> [!NOTE]
> **Changed default:** `AAATRIGGER` render faces are now preserved by default, and the old `-nonullifytrigger` option was removed. Pass `-nullifytrigger` to get the previous default behavior that strips trigger faces to NULL.
>
> **Changed default:** Exact full visibility is now the default instead of requiring `-full`. It culls best, and its tighter source clipping usually prunes the portal flow enough to also run faster than normal visibility. `-full` is still accepted for existing command lines; pass `-nofull` to get the previous default behavior.
>
> **Changed default:** Every used texture is now embedded in the BSP, so a compiled map is self contained, and the old `-nowadtextures` option was removed. Pass `-wadtextures` to get the previous default behavior that leaves textures in the WADs and records those paths on worldspawn for the engine to load at runtime. Embedding leaves no runtime WAD list, so `-nowadautodetect` and `-wadinclude` only take effect together with `-wadtextures` and CSG warns when they are passed alone. `-wadcfgfile` and `-wadconfig` still apply either way, because they select the WADs the textures are read from.

### `csg`

```text
hltools csg [options] <map>
```

| Group | Option | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Textures | `-wadtextures` | Reference textures from the WADs at runtime instead of embedding them in the BSP |
| Textures | `-wadinclude <name>` | Embed textures from WAD paths matching `name`; repeatable |
| Textures | `-nowadautodetect` | Keep unused WADs in the written worldspawn WAD list |
| Textures | `-wadcfgfile <file>` | Read WAD paths from a configuration file |
| Textures | `-wadconfig <name>` | Select a named block from the WAD configuration |
| Geometry | `-cliptype <type>` | `smallest`, `normalized`, `simple`, `precise`, `legacy`, `legacytrim`, or `exactunion`; default `simple`. A `func_detail` entity can override it with `zhlt_cliptype`; `func_group` and unknown values inherit the global setting |
| Geometry | `-noclip` | Do not create clipping hulls |
| Geometry | `-noskyclip` | Do not grow invisible clip copies from sky brushes |
| Geometry | `-scale <n>` | Scale the whole map around the origin |
| Geometry | `-worldextent <n>` | Set the world bounds per axis; default `65536` |
| Geometry | `-brushunion <n>` | Warn when the overlap ratio exceeds `n`; `0.1` means 10% |
| Geometry | `-hullfile <file>` | Load custom clipping hull sizes |
| Geometry | `-nullfile <file>` | Nullify faces belonging to listed classnames or targetnames |
| Geometry | `-nullifytrigger` | Convert AAATRIGGER faces to NULL instead of preserving their render models |
| Entities | `-onlyents` | Replace only the entity lump of an existing BSP |
| Entities | `-nolightopt` | Keep redundant named lights instead of stripping their targetnames |
| Misc | `-threads <n>` | Set worker threads |

`legacytrim` first builds the ordinary legacy collision, then BSP removes solid
regions within selected brushes that lie outside the union of their exact
brush-plus-player-box expansions. It preserves coverage from unselected brushes
and custom hull shapes, draw geometry, liquid contents, and exterior world fill.
It only removes collision; it does not repair gaps already present in legacy.
Use `-cliptype legacytrim` globally, or `zhlt_cliptype=legacytrim` on a
`func_detail` for local control. The optional trim data travels in the `.hsz`
intermediate, so CSG and BSP must both use this version of hltools. Extra clipping
planes can increase clipnode usage; an exceeded budget fails the compile.

`exactunion` constructs the union of selected brushes expanded by the collision
hull box. BSP removes excess legacy collision and adds the complete exact union,
so sloped brush seams follow that union even where legacy has low spots. Enable
it with `-cliptype exactunion`, or set `zhlt_cliptype=exactunion` on a `func_detail`.
Hulls 1–3 are computed independently. Within the selected bounds, existing solid
is retained only where source brush expansions or captured exterior fill cover
it. Unselected brushes keep their original expansion; active custom hull shapes
and draw geometry are preserved. The exact solid union overrides liquid contents
only inside the selected expansions. Both stages must support the version 2
`.hsz` extension. Exposed union faces guide the split order, and retained solid
regions are rebuilt together with the selected expansions to reduce redundant
clipnodes. Contents classification keeps the complete volume constraints.
Within a fixed search budget, BSP compares area and face-count split orders
and keeps the complete tree with fewer reachable nodes. An unfinished trial
is discarded; the completed tree remains available.
Final graph compaction reorders plane predicates using exact cofactors, searching
candidate planes up to four levels below each node. A bounded search accepts a
rewrite only when the total reachable clipnode count across all model/hull roots
decreases and the output depth limit is respected, preserving plane ties.
Predicates with exactly identical engine dot products use their ordered distance
thresholds to remove implied decisions, with the axial fast paths kept separate.
Trial accounting follows changed ancestors and shared references; unfinished
trials leave the completed graph intact.
Final collision nodes are ordered with parents before children, including
shared descendants, to respect GoldSrc's per-hull headnode lower bound.
By default, three deterministic exploration passes follow strict plane-order
compaction. This threshold optimization balances compile time and node count.
BSP's `-deepclip` option enables additional searches for collision unions
produced by `legacytrim` or `exactunion`. It also applies in a combined compile.
An `info_compile_parameters` entity can enable it with `bsp_deepclip=1`.
With `-deepclip`, up to eight deterministic rounds alternate three exploration
passes with strict plane-order compaction. Exploration permits equal-size
rewrites, with at most 256 accepted steps per pass, and retains the smallest
completed graph. A round with no reduction ends the search. This can expose reductions beyond a greedy
plane-order plateau while preserving collision classification and output depth.
A bounded pass rebuilds windows of up to six plane predicates from their
complete truth tables, treating deeper subtrees as opaque terminals. A subsequent
eight-predicate pass keeps up to four realizations per subproblem to expose
sharing between sibling branches. Candidate costs account for nodes already
shared outside the window. Exact descendant sets are cached within each window,
with at most one million stored node references before direct scoring resumes.
Replacements are
accepted only when all model/hull roots together use fewer nodes and satisfy
the depth limit; incomplete trials are discarded.
After window synthesis, up to four further rounds alternate exploration with
strict plane-order compaction. A round with no reduction ends this search too.
Three deterministic six-predicate window searches then explore equal-size
rewrites, retaining up to four realizations per subproblem and accepting at most
256 rewrites per pass. Each pass keeps its smallest completed graph; a reduction
triggers strict plane-order compaction before the next window search.
Complex unions can increase compile time and clipnode usage;
exceeding the geometry budget fails the compile.

### `bsp info`

Inspect a BSP without modifying it:

```powershell
hltools bsp info maps/example.bsp
```

The report includes completed compiler stages, entities, embedded and external textures, WAD references, lightmap atlas usage and every BSP lump against its engine limit.

Atlas usage comes with the per-texture breakdown, ranked by lightmap footprint. RAD prints the same table only when a map is close to overflowing; `bsp info` prints it at any usage, so a map sitting well inside the budget still shows which texture is spending it.

### `ripent`

```powershell
hltools ripent -export maps/example.bsp
hltools ripent -import maps/example.bsp
hltools ripent -textureexport maps/example.bsp [-out textures.wad]
hltools ripent -textureimport maps/example.bsp [-in textures.wad]
```

`-export` writes the entity lump to `maps/example.ent`; `-import` reads it back and rewrites only the entity lump, so every other lump stays byte identical. `-textureexport` writes the embedded miptex set as a WAD3 archive (`<map>_textures.wad` by default), and `-textureimport` replaces the texture lump from that archive and remaps every texinfo by name.

Texture import requires the WAD to contain every texture the BSP references; an external texture that is missing from the WAD aborts the import instead of leaving a dangling index.

### `inspect`

```powershell
hltools inspect maps/example.bsp
hltools inspect models/example.mdl -obj export.obj
```

For a BSP the report covers lumps, entities, models, hull 0 geometry and the textures that own the most faces; `-obj` writes every model's hull 0 polygons as OBJ groups named `model_N`. For a GoldSrc MDL it lists bones, sequences, skins, meshes, vertex and triangle counts and bounds; `-obj` writes frame 0 triangles with the skin name as the material.

### `bsp pack`

```text
hltools bsp pack <map.bsp> <output-dir> [options]
hltools bsp pack <map.bsp> <output.zip> [options]
```

Builds a distributable folder rooted like a GoldSrc game directory. When the
output path ends in `.zip`, it writes one ZIP archive instead. The BSP is written
to `maps/`, referenced assets retain paths such as `models/`, `sprites/`,
`sound/`, and `gfx/env/`, and `maps/<map>.res` lists the files using the plain
GoldSrc resource-list format.

Dependencies are discovered from the entity lump, worldspawn WAD and sky
settings, model texture/sequence companions, and existing map description,
detail, navigation, and overview files. Entries from an existing map `.res` are
merged as authoritative hand-declared dependencies.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-game <dir>` | Source game directory. Inferred when the input BSP is inside its `maps` directory |
| `-base <dir>` | Installed base content to recognize but exclude from the package and `.res`; repeatable. Sibling roots such as `cstrike` and `valve` are inferred when available |
| `-force` | Overwrite files already present below the output directory or replace an existing ZIP |
| `-strict` | Fail without writing the package if any referenced resource is missing |

### `bsp port`

`bsp port` converts a Source BSP into an editable GoldSrc MAP and its companion
assets:

```powershell
hltools bsp port source.bsp staging/map.map -game path/to/game -game path/to/hl2 -toolwad sdhlt.wad
```

What we currently support:

- Original brush and brushside geometry
- Entity and light conversion, including one player start
- Detail, water, transparent, masked, and additive brushes
- Displacements converted to `func_detail`, or to studio models with `-dispmodels`
- Materials converted to a companion WAD
- Materials and models loaded from the BSP, `-game` directories, and VPK files
- Studio model conversion and static prop placement
- Optional `.phy` collision converted to brushes
- 2D skybox export to `gfx/env`
- Unlit material support for RAD
- MAP, WAD, model, and sky output in a game-directory layout

Source `sky_camera` scenes are not converted yet. `-toolwad` supplies compiler
textures such as `NULL`, `CLIP`, and `SKY`.

For the best sky quality, use `-skysize` to export the skybox at its full
resolution, then build a 3D model skybox with `hltools model skybox`. See
[Full-resolution skybox models](#full-resolution-skybox-models).

Options:

| Option | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `-game <dir>` | Add a content search root; repeatable | None |
| `-toolwad <file>` | Add a compiler-texture WAD | None |
| `-skysize <n>` | Set sky-face size (`64..4096`); `0` skips export | `256` |
| `-skyexposure <n>` | Scale HDR sky brightness | `1.0` |
| `-maxtexsize <n>` | Cap WAD textures (`16..512`, step 16) | `512` |
| `-lmtexsize <n>` | Derive lightmap density from this size instead (`16..512`, step 16) | Follows `-maxtexsize` |
| `-fulltex <material>` | Bypass `-maxtexsize`; repeatable | None |
| `-noflattex` | Keep single-colour materials at full size | Off (they become 16x16) |
| `-nolightgamma` | Keep Source's raw light colours instead of converting sRGB to linear | Off (conversion on) |
| `-maxskinsize <n>` | Cap model skins (`16..512`, step 16) | `512` |
| `-chunkskins <n>` | Split model skins into `1`, `2`, `4`, or `8` tiles per axis | `1` (off) |
| `-sharedpalette` | Share one palette across material tiles | Off |
| `-tilearea <10..100>` | Limit the surface area receiving dedicated tiles | `100` |
| `-disppower <0..4>` | Cap the drawn displacement tessellation | `4` (Source's own detail) |
| `-dispmodels` | Draw displacements as studio models rather than brushes | Off |
| `-dispchunk <n>` | Terrain model chunk size (`128..8192`) | `1024` |
| `-dispclip <scope>` | Displacement collision: `all`, `floors`, or `none` | `all` |
| `-dispmerge <n>` | Merge collision cells flatter than `<n>` units into one brush (`0..512`) | `48` |
| `-phyclip` | Convert `.phy` collision to brush entities | Off |

Skin tiling avoids downscaling large model skins. Lower `-chunkskins` or
`-tilearea` when model size or draw calls matter more than texture detail.

`-phyclip` converts prop collision into brushes. Complex collision can exceed
GoldSrc's 32,767 clipnode limit.

#### Texture size and lightmap density

GoldSrc ties lightmap resolution to texture scale: one luxel per 16 texels, so
a texture's atlas cost grows with the square of its texel density. A Source map
tiling a 256px texture every 64 units sits at 4 texels/unit, four times the
density Source itself lit the map at, which is why a naive port routinely needs
several times the 64-page atlas it is allowed.

`-maxtexsize` moves both at once: it shrinks the stored image and the density
together, preserving world tiling. `-lmtexsize` separates them - the texture
keeps every pixel and instead tiles over proportionally more world.

The stored image, as written to the WAD:

![Stored texture at each setting](.github/assets/lmtexsize-stored.png)

The same wall in game, over a fixed area of world:

![The same wall in world space](.github/assets/lmtexsize-world.png)

**A** is the baseline. **B** caps the stored size, and loses detail while
tiling identically. **C** keeps A's pixels but spends B's luxels, covering more
world per repeat. So `-lmtexsize` does not buy sharpness - apparent sharpness
is texels-per-unit and nothing else - it buys *fewer visible repeats* at the
same sharpness. Use it where a texture's tiling is repetitive and its scale is
not load bearing; avoid it where the tiling scale is part of the design.

`hltools bsp info` reports the atlas budget per texture, which is what
identifies the material to cap first.

#### Light colours

VRAD lights with the linear colour, while HLRAD uses the raw ratios
(`intensity = RGB / 255 * brightness`). Carried across unchanged every low
channel stays too strong, and coloured light desaturates towards white, so
a ported light entity has its `_light` and `_diffuse_light` colours
converted from sRGB to linear.

Only the colour channels convert; brightness is a tuning decision and is
left alone. `-nolightgamma` keeps Source raw values.

#### Displacements

Displacement terrain is expensive in GoldSrc: as brushes, a heavily displaced
map overruns the plane, node and vertex limits long before it is drawable.
`-disppower` caps the drawn tessellation, and `-dispmodels` draws the surface
from studio models instead, which cost no planes, nodes, faces or vertices.
A GoldSrc model does not collide, so collision stays with the brushes and is
controlled separately by `-dispclip` and `-dispmerge`.

### `wad`

List WAD or BSP textures:

```powershell
hltools wad list halflife.wad
hltools wad list maps/example.bsp
```

Extract indexed 8-bit BMP files:

```powershell
hltools wad extract halflife.wad extracted_textures
hltools wad extract maps/example.bsp extracted_textures
```

Extract embedded BSP textures directly into a WAD:

```powershell
hltools wad extract maps/example.bsp example_embedded.wad
```

Build a WAD3 archive from indexed BMP files:

```powershell
hltools wad build extracted_textures custom.wad
```

Use `-force` to overwrite output. BSP extraction skips internal lightmap textures generated by RAD by default; `-all` includes them. External BSP texture references have names but no embedded pixel data and therefore cannot be extracted.

### `lightmap`

```powershell
hltools lightmap maps/example.bsp example_lightmaps.bmp
```

The output is a deterministic 24 bit RGB atlas containing every lit face and every light style. It is suitable for visual inspection, image diffing and pixel level comparisons. Use `-force` to overwrite an existing BMP.

### `decompile`

`decompile` restores a GoldSrc BSP as a Valve 220 MAP:

```powershell
hltools decompile maps/example.bsp decompiled/example.map
hltools decompile maps/example.bsp decompiled/example.map -wad decompiled/example.wad
```

If the BSP contains an hltools source archive, its root MAP is restored directly.
Otherwise the decompiler reconstructs convex brushes from the hull-0 BSP tree.
Embedded textures are written to a companion WAD and added to worldspawn.

`-reconstruct` ignores the archive and forces BSP reconstruction. `-wad` changes
the companion WAD path, while `-force` allows existing outputs to be replaced.

#### Embedded MAP archive

hltools stores the optional source archive after the standard BSP data:

```text
[GoldSrc BSP][BSPX directory][HLTOOLS_EMBED_LOCATOR][ZIP to end of file]
```

`HLTOOLS_EMBED_LOCATOR` contains this little-endian version-1 payload:

```c
uint16_t version;      // 1
uint16_t header_size;  // 16
uint32_t flags;        // reserved, zero
uint64_t zip_offset;   // absolute file offset; ZIP continues to EOF
```

Vanilla GoldSrc reads the standard lumps and ignores the appended data. Tools
such as 7-Zip can open the archive directly from the BSP.

The reconstruction is based on [HalfLife.UnifiedSdk.MapDecompiler](https://github.com/twhl-community/HalfLife.UnifiedSdk.MapDecompiler/).

<details>
<summary><strong>CSG entities and brush keys</strong></summary>

| Entity or key | Compiler behavior | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `worldspawn` | Reads `wad`, `mapversion`, `wadcfgfile` and `wadconfig`. CSG clears `wad` once the textures are embedded, or under `-wadtextures` replaces it with the WAD paths the BSP still needs, and writes `compiler` plus the UTC ISO-8601 `compiled_at` timestamp | WAD keys absent and map version `0` |
| `func_group` | Moves its brushes into worldspawn and removes the entity | Not applicable |
| `func_detail` | Uses the same merge as `func_group`. Detail behavior comes from the `zhlt_detaillevel` values retained on its brushes | Detail level `0` |
| `info_hullshape` | Defines a named collision hull from at most one brush other than ORIGIN. `defaulthulls` bits `2`, `4` and `8` assign the shape to hulls 1, 2 and 3. `disabled 1` makes a selected shape use normal hull expansion | `defaulthulls 0` and `disabled 0` |
| `info_compile_parameters` | Supplies stage-prefixed defaults to unified and individual compiler commands. Traditional intermediate BSPs carry it until RAD removes it; embedded BSPs expose the recipe through their root MAP. Explicit command-line values win | No compiler defaults |
| Named lights | Lights with a `targetname` share an allocated engine style from 32 through 63. Redundant targetnames on the same style are removed unless `-nolightopt` is used | Optimization on and unnamed lights on style `0` |
| `info_sunlight` | Writes a marked `light_environment` for the sun values used by runtime model lighting. RAD excludes this copy from compiled map lighting | No entity |
| `light_shadow` | Retains `convertfrom` metadata for RAD and changes to the runtime `convertto` classname | `convertto light` |
| `light_bounce` | Retains `convertfrom` metadata for RAD and changes to the runtime `convertto` classname | `convertto light` |
| `light_surface` | Retains `_tex` metadata for RAD and changes to a runtime light classname | `convertto light` |
| `zhlt_noclip <0..1>` | A nonzero value prevents clip hull creation for every brush in the entity | `0` |
| `zhlt_detaillevel <n>` | Sets a nonnegative visible detail level. Level `0` is structural and higher levels are processed after lower levels | `0` |

| `zhlt_chopup <n>` | Lets this brush be chopped by brushes up to `<n>` detail levels above its own level | `0` |
| `zhlt_clipnodedetaillevel <n>` | Sets a separate nonnegative detail level for collision hulls | `0` |
| `zhlt_coplanarpriority <n>` | Chooses between coplanar faces with the same contents and detail level. The higher value wins | `0` |
| `zhlt_hull1 <name>` | Uses the named `info_hullshape` for collision hull 1 | Normal hull 1 expansion |
| `zhlt_hull2 <name>` | Uses the named `info_hullshape` for collision hull 2 | Normal hull 2 expansion |
| `zhlt_hull3 <name>` | Uses the named `info_hullshape` for collision hull 3 | Normal hull 3 expansion |
| `zhlt_transform` | Accepts `scale`, `x y z` or `scale x y z` to transform Valve 220 brush geometry around the entity origin during CSG | No transform |
| `zhlt_usemodel <name>` | Removes this entity's brush geometry and reuses the model of the entity with the matching `targetname`. `null` clears the model | No model reuse |
| `zhlt_invisible <0..1>` | A nonzero value converts normal faces to NULL while preserving compiler tool faces | `0` |
| `zhlt_usestyle <name>` | Replaces the `targetname` used for switchable light style allocation. `null` disables style allocation for this entity | Use `targetname` |
| `light_origin <targetname>` | Offsets brush model lighting and shadows so the model center is evaluated at the target entity's origin. CSG writes `model_center` automatically | Use the model's compiled position |
| `zhlt_minsmaxs <minx miny minz maxx maxy maxz>` | Replaces compiled brush model bounds. A BOUNDINGBOX brush normally writes this key | Bounds from visible brush geometry |

|---|---|
| `NULL*` | Omit the rendered face while retaining the brush plane and solid geometry |
| `SKIP` | Discard the face from BSP splitting and output. Use on the unused sides of a HINT brush |
| `HINT` | Force a BSP split for visibility control; pair unused sides with SKIP |
| `SOLIDHINT` | Keep solid contents while making the face discardable. The face is ignored when choosing BSP splitters and is not written to the BSP |
| `BEVELHINT` | Use SOLIDHINT behavior and prevent the marked plane from expanding into collision hulls |
| `SPLITFACE` | Give the brush hint contents and convert the marked faces to SKIP so the volume can split intersecting faces without producing render surfaces |
| `BEVEL`, `BEVELBRUSH` | Prevent one marked plane or every plane in the brush from expanding into collision hulls |
| `CLIP`, `CLIPHULL1`, `CLIPHULL2`, `CLIPHULL3` | Invisible clipping geometry for all or selected hulls |

| `env_sky*` | Set sky contents but omit the face from normal BSP surfaces for engine specific sky rendering |
| `!...` | Set water, slime or lava contents. `!cur_*` names also encode liquid push direction |

| `..._HIDDEN` | Compile normally but omit the face from renderable leaf lists |
| `%<0..255>name` | Set an absolute minimum light value from 0 through 255 on every face using the texture |

Brushes may not mix incompatible contents. ORIGIN and BOUNDINGBOX brushes are invalid in worldspawn and `func_group`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>BSP and VIS entities</strong></summary>

| Entity or key | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Point entity with `origin` | Marks its leaf as occupied during outside filling. BSP tests one unit above the stored origin | Entities without `origin` do not mark a leaf |
| `info_player_start` | Marks occupied space and searches a 3 by 3 area from `-16` through `16` on X and Y when the original point is solid | Same origin handling as other point entities |

| `info_portal neighbor <0..16>` | Also grants the target visibility to source leaves up to this many portal hops away. Values are clamped to the range | `0` |
| `info_leaf targetname <name>` | Supplies the destination leaf for matching `info_portal` entities. The last matching entity wins | No target name |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>RAD entities and texture tables</strong></summary>

Color values accept a brightness, `r g b`, or `r g b brightness`. Texture table names ignore letter case.

#### Light entities

| Entity or key | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `light _light` | Sets emitted brightness with one value, RGB with three values or RGB plus brightness with four values | Missing or invalid values emit no light |
| `light _fade <n>` | Overrides the global distance fade for this light. A value of `0` inherits the command line setting | `-fade`, normally `1.0` |
| `light _fast <0..1>` | A value of `1` gathers this light through patches instead of calculating the full direct contribution at every luxel | `0` |
| `light style <0..63>` | Sets the emitted lightmap style. Negative values are converted to their absolute value | `0` |
| `light target <name>` | Aims a `light`, `light_spot` or `light_environment` at the matching target entity | No target |
| `light angles`, `angle`, `pitch` | Supply direction when no valid target exists. A nonzero `angle` overrides yaw and a nonzero `pitch` overrides the pitch component of `angles` | `0 0 0`, which points along positive X for directional lights |
| `light _cone <degrees>` | Sets the inner spotlight cone | `10` |
| `light _cone2 <degrees>` | Sets the outer spotlight cone and cannot be narrower than `_cone` | Same as `_cone` |
| `light _sky <n>` | Converts a targeted or otherwise directional light into skylight when the value is nonzero | `0` |
| `light_spot` | Always uses directional spotlight behavior and accepts the normal light keys | Positive X direction with a 10 degree cone |
| `light_environment` | Emits direct sunlight from `_light`. Diffuse sky color blends from `_diffuse_light` near the sun direction to `_diffuse_light2` on the opposite sky | `_diffuse_light` falls back to `_light` and `_diffuse_light2` falls back to `_diffuse_light` |
| `light_environment _spread <0..180>` | Spreads direct sunlight across an angular area to create a penumbra | `0` |
| `info_sunlight` | Chooses the sun values written for runtime model lighting without adding another sun to compiled map lighting | No dedicated runtime sun override |

#### Surface lights

Place texture emission definitions in `<mapname>.rad` next to `<mapname>.map`,
or use an `info_texlights` entity inside the map. The generic `lights.rad`
fallback remains supported, but may be removed in a future release.

| Key | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `_tex <texture>` | Selects faces with this texture name without regard to letter case | Required for a match |
| `_light <color>` | Replaces RAD file emission on every matched face | No emission when a selector matches without `_light` |
| `origin <x y z>` | Supplies the selector position and resolves competing selectors by nearest face center | Entity origin |
| `_frange <n>` | Rejects face centers farther than this distance from `origin` | No range limit |
| `_fdist <n>` | Rejects faces whose plane distance from `origin` exceeds this value | No plane distance limit |
| `_fclass <classname>` | Restricts matches to faces owned by this classname | Any classname |
| `_fname <targetname>` | Restricts matches to faces owned by this targetname | Any targetname |
| `_texcolor <r g b>` | Replaces the texture reflectivity color used for emission and bounce lighting | Reflectivity from the texture palette |
| `_scale <n>` | Multiplies emission. Values at or below zero disable the surface light | `1` |
| `_cone <degrees>` | Sets the inner surface emission cone | `90` |
| `_cone2 <degrees>` | Sets the outer surface emission cone and cannot be narrower than `_cone` | `90` |
| `_chop <n>` | Replaces the calculated patch size for matched faces and is clamped to at least `1` | Inherit `-chop` or `-texchop` with texture scaling |
| `_texlightgap <n>` | Rejects texlight paths that cross a gap larger than this value | Inherit `-texlightgap`, normally `0` |
| `_fast <0..2>` | Selects emission gathering: `0` = automatic, `1` = fast through patches or `2` = accurate per luxel | `0` |
| `style <0..63>` | Sets the emitted lightmap style on matched faces | `0` |
| `convertto <classname>` | Selects the runtime classname, which must begin with `light` | `light` |

When multiple `light_surface` selectors match, the nearest origin wins.

#### Dynamic shadow and bounce controls

| Entity or key | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `light_shadow target <name>` | Applies a controlled shadow style to the opaque brush entity with this `targetname` | No effect without a target |
| `light_shadow style <0..63>` | Sets the style carried by the targeted model's shadow | `0` |
| `light_bounce target <name>` | Applies a separate bounce style to patches on the brush entity with this `targetname` | No effect without a target |
| `light_bounce style <0..63>` | Sets the style that receives bounced light from the targeted model | `0` |
| `convertto <classname>` | Selects the runtime classname used after CSG stores the compiler metadata | `light` |

The `light_shadow` target needs `zhlt_lightflags` bit 2.

#### Texture table entities

Each key except `classname` and `origin` is a texture name.

| Entity | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `info_texlights` | Defines emitted color using RAD file syntax. Its definitions override earlier RAD-file definitions for the same texture | No emission definition |
| `info_minlights` | Sets the minimum light for the texture in the range 0 through 1 | No texture specific minimum |
| `info_unlittextures` | Bakes a constant-white lightmap on faces using each enabled texture, preserving whole-surface fullbright materials such as Source `UnlitGeneric` | Normal lightmapping |
| `info_chopscale` | Multiplies the calculated patch size by a positive value. Zero and negative values are ignored | `1` |
| `info_smoothvalue` | Replaces the smoothing angle in degrees for the texture | Inherit `-smooth`, normally `50` degrees |
| `info_translucent` | Sets scalar or RGB light transmission from 0 through 1 between the front and back of a face | `0 0 0` |
| `info_angularfade` | Sets a nonnegative texlight angular power and an optional nonnegative scale. An omitted scale starts at `1` before energy normalization | Power `1` and scale `1` |

#### Brush model lighting keys

| Key | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `_minlight <0..1>` | Sets a minimum light value on every face of the model | `0` |
| `style <0..63>` | Sets the surface emission style for the model's face patches | `0` |
| `style -1` | Allocates a switchable texlight style for a brush model that is not a light entity | Not used |
| `style -2` | Allocates a switchable texlight style with the initial state reversed | Not used |
| `style -3` | Makes texlight emission use the style allocated to a real light with the same `targetname` | Not used |
| `light_origin <targetname>` | Evaluates model lighting and shadows at the target entity's origin | Use the model's compiled position |
| `model_center <x y z>` | Supplies the model center used with `light_origin`. CSG writes this key automatically | Center of visible brush geometry |
| `zhlt_lightflags` bit `2` | Adds model faces to RAD's opaque shadow caster list | Flags `0` |
| `zhlt_lightflags` bit `8` | Prevents an opaque model from blocking light as a solid volume. Combine with bit `2` as value `10` | Off |
| `zhlt_customshadow` | Sets nonnegative scalar or RGB light transmission through a model using light flag bit `2` | `0`, fully opaque |
| `zhlt_striprad <0..1>` | A nonzero value removes lightmaps from every model face | `0` |
| `zhlt_copylight <targetname>` | Copies sampled model lighting from the target origin to samples beneath this entity's origin | No copy |
| `zhlt_embedlightmap <0..1>` | A nonzero value bakes face lightmaps into generated textures | `0` |
| `zhlt_embedlightmapresolution <n>` | Selects an embedded texture resolution of `1`, `2`, `4`, `8` or `16` | `1` |

#### Studio model shadows

| Entity or key | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `env_static` | Makes the entity's `model` block light. `spawnflags` bit `4` disables it | Off |
| `zhlt_studioshadow <0\|1>` | Makes any entity with a `model` key block light | `0` |
| `zhlt_shadowmode <0..2>` | `0` tests each triangle's bounds, `1` tests every triangle and honors masked skins, `2` simplifies the mesh to the reference vertex budget and tests expanded facets (skins are ignored, as in the reference) | `1` |
| `body`, `skin` | Select the bodypart model and skin family used for the shadow mesh | `0` |
| `scale`, `xform <x y z>` | Place the shadow mesh at a uniform or per-axis scale, clamped to `0.01..16` | `1` |

Models resolve against the game directory (the parent of the map's directory), then the map directory, the working directory and each `-waddir` folder. A masked skin lets light through where the sampled palette index is `255`; additive skins never block. `-nostudioshadow` ignores every request.

#### Studio model BSP

A point entity carrying `zhlt_studiobsp` is replaced by solid geometry baked from its `model`, so the prop becomes part of the map instead of a runtime model.

| Entity or key | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `zhlt_studiobsp <0\|1>` | Bakes the entity's `model` into a `func_wall` of five-sided detail brush prisms, one per triangle | `0` |
| `zhlt_studiobsp_collision <0\|1>` | Builds clip hulls `1..3`; `0` leaves render geometry only | `1` |
| `zhlt_studiobsp_doublesided <0\|1>` | Accepted for compatibility; brush prisms are always closed and textured on all five sides | `1` |
| `zhlt_studiobsp_thickness <n>` | Prism depth in world units, clamped to `0.01..512` | `1` |
| `zhlt_studiobsp_world <0\|1>` | Adds the prisms to `worldspawn` and turns the marker into `info_null` | `0` |

`body`, `skin`, `scale` and `xform` select the pose and placement exactly like studio shadows. The generated brushes are detail brushes (`detail_level` and `clipnode_detail_level` `1`) and get `zhlt_lightflags` bit `2`, so VIS does not split on them while RAD still treats them as opaque. Every skin is resampled to a legal BSP size (a multiple of `16`, at most `512`), embedded into the miptex lump and named with a unique hash suffix of at most 15 characters; masked skins keep the `{` prefix.

Brush baking is meant for props that fit the map's brush, plane and clipnode budgets. Converted geometry counts against all of them: a 900-triangle model produces 900 brushes, 4,500 sides and roughly 10,000 planes, so very dense models should stay runtime entities or use fewer triangles. A model with no embedded skins is rejected with a warning. Triangles thinner than the CSG plane epsilon are inflated inside their own plane to 0.5 world units so heavily downscaled props still produce closed brushes, while degenerate triangles or ones with no usable texture projection are counted and skipped.

## Console and log output

The console shows changed settings, compact loading statistics, live phase progress, rows above 15% in the BSP usage chart, warning totals and a final elapsed time line. The logfile keeps the full settings table, phase detail and complete BSP chart.

`hltools bsp info` exposes the same BSP limit accounting without recompiling a map.

## Accuracy and compatibility

| Path | Contract |
|---|---|
| CPU `csg`, `bsp`, `vis`, `rad` | Reference compatible path for supported maps and options |
| `hltools compile` | Same stage implementations with a memory handoff and one combined log |
| `rad -gpu` | Deterministic approximate acceleration; small differences from floating point calculations are expected |
| `bsp info`, `wad list`, `lightmap` | Do not modify their input BSP or WAD |
| `wad extract/build` | Preserves indexed pixels, four mip levels and the 256-color palette |
| `decompile` | Restores an embedded GoldSrc MAP or reconstructs GoldSrc BSP geometry |
| `bsp port` | Converts Source BSP content to GoldSrc MAP, WAD, models, and sky assets |

For strict reference comparisons, use CPU RAD and a fixed thread count, normally `-threads 1`.

The scripts require Python 3 and NumPy. The `lightmap` command provides a fast visual companion to these numeric comparisons.

Studio model shadows were compared against sdHLT 1.2.0 on a room with one `env_static` model:

| Mode | Result |
|---|---|
| `zhlt_shadowmode 1` | Lighting lump byte-identical (634 faces, 432,579 bytes) |
| `zhlt_shadowmode 2` | Same structure (1,306 -> 718 vertices, 498 vs 499 triangles) but about 11% of luxels differ; progressive-mesh collapse tie-breaking is sensitive to arithmetic order, so numeric parity is not guaranteed |

The sdHLT `zhlt_studiobsp` shell path requires a closed surface and rejects open models with `cannot form a closed BSP shell`, while `hltools` bakes every triangle as a five-sided prism; open models that sdHLT refuses may still compile here.

### Remove a TrenchBroom group volume

`tools/remove_map_group_volume.py` treats a named TrenchBroom group containing
six slab brushes as a hollow box and removes map content inside its inner
bounds. The default is a read-only dry run and preserves every brush that
crosses the boundary:

```powershell
python tools/remove_map_group_volume.py maps/example.map toberemoved
python tools/remove_map_group_volume.py maps/example.map toberemoved -o maps/example_clean.map
python tools/remove_map_group_volume.py maps/example.map toberemoved --in-place
```

`--in-place` always creates a timestamped backup. Use `--group-source` to read
the marker from another map or TrenchBroom autosave. `--mode centroid`
reproduces the less conservative centroid selection, while
`--mode intersecting` deliberately removes boundary-crossing brushes.

## What remains

- Implement GoldSrc QC/SMD compilation and decompilation under `hltools model`; `model convert` writes binary `.mdl` directly and has no QC/SMD path.
- Implement VIS `-maxdistance`; it is recognized today but fails explicitly.
- Parallelize useful BSP work; `-threads` configures the shared pool, but most BSP processing is still serial.
- Continue expanding compiler fixtures, complete pipeline maps, regression cases and automated test coverage.
- Decide whether to add the remaining CSG compatibility switches that affect output: `-clipeconomy`, `-noclipeconomy` and `-nonulltex` for CSG.
- Add strict validation of unknown options to the four compiler parsers; newer asset commands already reject unknown options.
- Decide whether the omitted legacy cosmetic controls such as `-nolog`, `-verbose`, priority, language and distributed netvis are still useful.

Unsupported functionality fails explicitly where silent fallback could produce a misleading BSP.

The stage libraries expose entry points that operate in memory. BSP structures stored on disk stay fixed, while compiler state lives in owned containers rather than shared global arrays.

## Development and tests

Tests are registered with CTest and built by default. From the repository root:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

CTest can select a layer, compiler stage, or entity without knowing the name of
the executable that contains it:

```powershell
ctest --test-dir build -C Release -L unit
ctest --test-dir build -C Release -L csg
ctest --test-dir build -C Release -R trigger_once
```

The test tree is organized by purpose:

- `tests/unit` contains focused library tests with no compiler pipeline.
- `tests/entities` contains compiler contracts, normally one source file per classname.
- `tests/integration` crosses library or compiler boundaries.
- `tests/regression` is reserved for minimized reproductions of fixed bugs.
- `tests/fixtures` contains source maps, assets and fixture generators.
- `tests/support` contains shared builders, helpers for scratch directories and the test API.

Focused tests use doctest behind the lowercase `suite`, `test`, `expect` and
`require` aliases in `tests/support/test.h`. The dependency is pinned and
downloaded into the build tree during CMake configuration. A production
configuration can omit all test targets with `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`.

Keep CPU compiler output identical at the byte level unless a behavior change is intentional and documented. Use the comparison scripts before accepting geometry or lighting changes.
